The PlayStation Vita was the spiritual successor to the original PlayStation Portable and I wanted one for quite a while.
Before today, I only ever saw a Vita once though.
One friend back in school bought one the day it came out and I remember looking at it and thinking "damn this thing looks like so much fun".
Then I looked at the price tag and that was the end of that.

Now that I'm a responsible adult with stable income and the consoles that interested me when I was younger are both easily moddable and affordable second hand, I finally got one.
My fianc√© and I walked over to a used games shop 5 minutes from my apartment and lucky for me, they happened to have one Vita in stock with the charging cable.
Even luckier, it was a PCH-1004, which has a ( in my opinion ) really nice looking OLED screen that was dropped with the PCH-20XX / Slim models post 2013.
I looked at the quite limited selection of games they had in stock for the Vita, but didn't spot anything that struck a chord with me.
That wasn't a problem at all though, because I just got done modding this thing and holy shit this was a breeze.

After reading carefully through the [hacks.guide](https://vita.hacks.guide) pages for the console, it took me around 20 minutes to get everything up and running.
PKGj for installing games, some custom themes ( ofc I had to put a Miku theme on it ) and some homebrew just to mess around.

So far, I'm loving this thing.
It's such a fun console that I'm genuinely kinda sad that Sony let it down so hard when it came to marketing in my region.
The Vita honestly deserved better.
Nonetheless, I'll try and get a toolchain set up over the next few days to start writing some homebrew for it.
I'll likely post something once I get my first executable on the console.

That's about it, cya.

PS: I forgot to commit this post to the blog, so I'm pushing it now on the 11th of November. Oops.
