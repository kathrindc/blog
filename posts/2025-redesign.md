So as you can no doubt tell, the site has changed a little bit.
The old design felt quite... boring, to be honest.
And though it was certainly functional, it didn't really have any distinct character.

I've recently been clicking through a bunch of indie web pages and I've been absolutely delighted by the wonderful amount of creativity people put into their sites.
So I thought, might as well give it a shot in a design language I like.
A certain design pattern that seems to be having a little bit of a resurgence.
That gem of a design language, which was the spirit of the late 2000s and early 2010s.
**AERO FRUTIGER!**

If you've read my older posts, you might have noticed I have a bit of a soft-spot for that era of computing and gaming.
I am one of those people who still regularly play games on a PS3 or PS Vita.
And especially now, after I relapsed and have once again made a semi-custom Linux rice that follows the aero aesthetic, it only felt right to match my website to my desktop rice.

After finding a cool background image, which matched the background colour I wanted to go for (thanks to Liam / Z2r btw for letting me use them), the rest kinda came together pretty quickly.
With the site menu buttons I tried to mimic the "Web 2.0 Gloss" that was everywhere a decade or so ago, back when most buttons where images lmao.
Obviously I didn't wanna make the browser load a billion image files (not counting the fanlisting buttons, those are important lol).
So I attempted to get somewhere close enough using CSS gradients, which I also did for the window borders around the main blocks of the site.
Another thing that I also remembered from messing around with it quite a while ago was the SCM Player you can see at the top of the page.
I put some songs in, which I like and that fit the general vibe of the site.
And since I'm already making something in homage of that era, I put a small Madobe Nanami on one of the buttons.
Idk it just felt fitting, okay? xD

It's certainly not the best looking aero-ish site I assume, but I think it came out quite decently.
Although I'll certainly continue tinkering with it over the course of the next couple of weeks.

During the course of this redesign I also migrated the site to [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) (pronounced eleventy), which made the customisations I wanted to do quite a bit easier than if I had remained on Zola.
There's nothing wrong with Zola per se, but it simply didn't offer the flexibility I would have wanted for this new design.
I might end up making a separate post talking about 11ty, cause it's very DIY, but I love it.

Also, I'm hoping I can continue doing once per week posts, so maybe I'll be back next week. Who knows lol.
Bye ^-^
