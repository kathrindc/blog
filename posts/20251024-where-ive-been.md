Hey there!

It's been a hot minute, huh? How've you been? Any progress on that thing you were working on?

I have been quite busy over the last two months.
I actually got married a week ago.
Still feels quite surreal to some extent.
It's always felt like something in the far future, and now, it's finally happened and it was absolutely wonderful.
My husband and I are still working on some stuff regarding residence, but we'll get that sorted as soon as possible.

Organising everything kinda took up all my day and in the few free minutes I've been working on a personal project.
So the blog has gone kinda idle in my absence.
The blog itself is a side-project, so taking time away to write for it has become kinda rough.
Sorry about that.

Hopefully I will be able to resume posting on here relatively soon, as there are also quite a few ideas for pages that I want to add.

Not that much to write right now honestly, so I'll keep it brief. See ya.
