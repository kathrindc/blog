So I didn't get around to post anything last week.
That is because I have been working on a side-project for my day-job on the weekend and usually in the evenings I've just been absolutely shattered.
Without going into too much detail, we are currently finalising a major project at work and the "Product Owner" has been behaving themselves like a right arse.
Honestly I've never seen anyone so bloody incapable in my life.
Sometimes I genuinely wonder what goes on in these peoples' heads, because it obviously can't be all too much.

Because of this entire debacle, my colleague and I have decided to make a platform (specific to our company's internal needs), on which we will henceforth do some proper requirements engineering whenever a new project is started.
I am sick and tired of this moving-target bullshit with no-one willing to take accountability for their decisions and a complete lack of direction due to people wanting to profile themselves on commanding others around with orders that make next to no sense.

Ranting aside, I've also been trying to go outdoors a bit more.
So I have been making the most of the good weather by going to swim in the WÃ¶rthersee more often.
My roommate and I both bought a season ticket for the public beach there so it's also a nifty motivator to get my money worth.

I've also been working on a new section for this website, in which I want to put small little reviews for the movies my friends and I watch during our weekly movie nights.
This section isn't gonna be updated according to a strict schedule, but rather when I find the time.
I just think it could be a nifty way of making a list of the movies we've watched so far and also maybe show you some movies you haven't seen yet.
I don't know to be honest, it sounded quite nice in my head, so I'm gonna see how well it works.

Alright, that's pretty much it for the update.
I'm gonna get back to ocean fishing in Final Fantasy XIV now, as I've been getting suckered back into playing it recently.

Have a nice evening, and see ya around! :)
