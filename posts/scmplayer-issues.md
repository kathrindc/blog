Well this is extremely annoying.
Not even a week after I push the website redesign live, the music player I used (SCMPlayer) seems like it either has some downtime or has gone fully defunct.
I am looking for an alternative at the moment, but not entirely sure yet.
WikPlayer seemed like an okay choice, but no matter what I do, it just removes all the content from my site when I insert it.
That issue combined with the fact that it seems to load some advertising and analytics scripts is pretty much a no from my side.
I'll keep looking around to find a new player widget, but for now, the site is sadly music-less.
