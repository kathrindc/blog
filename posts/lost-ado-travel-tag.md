Well, I am already kinda bummed about having to go back home without James coming down to Austria with me, but it somehow just got worse.
I just got some coffee and some food in the departures area of Stansted when I noticed that part of the travel tag I got at the Ado concert I was at recently had disappeared.
I've already asked around, but seems like it just vanished into thin air.

Really fucking sad about this ngl, because I really liked this tag and of course it'd have to be this thing I'd somehow lose.
The one time I actually really like a bag accessory, it disappears not even two weeks after I get it.

Honestly this post is just me shouting into the void, because I'm really fucking sad about this.
On the unbelievably rare off-chance that someone in Stansted has seen it, I registered it on lostproperty.org so if you spot it, e-mail me.
