Due to the recent CloudFlare outages I've reconsidered having all my domains linked with them.
And since I've also had this domain registered at a separate registrar I thought it might as well be time to switch everything over proper.

So now the webhost and domain are run at Hetzner.
Since I'm on a normal web-host package I've also got PHP on here now.
Never really set it up on the old host, cause I didn't need it.
The only thing I still need to sort out is the automatic deployment via GitHub Actions to the site, but that's something I'll do at another point.

Other than that, things are certainly happening; I am creatively blocked at the moment, which is annoying, but hey, whatever.
