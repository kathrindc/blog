You every just get that feeling that somehow everything and nothing is happening at the same time?
Well, that pretty much sums up the last three or so weeks of my life.

Between still working my normal 9 to 5 remotely, going through tons of paperwork, flying back and forth between two countries constantly, still trying to have something resembling a social life, attempting to work on my side-projects when possible and the fact that I haven't slept that great recently; I am a bit worn out.
And now, nevertheless, I am once again slowly making my way back home.

The only reason I actually had to return to Austria this time around, is that I ran out of my medication.
And since there was no proper way of getting them in the UK, apart from going to a doctor, explaining my entire medical history and hoping they give me a local prescription, I was pretty much out of options.
Given everything I've heard about waiting times with the NHS (literally two days ago, a good friend told me that it took her doctor **eleven months** to have a 10 minute call with her to confirm a diagnosis, which is absolutely absurd, as that could've simply been an e-mail), I wasn't sure I wanted to take the risk of potentially running out, as I am supposed to take it daily.
So back to Austria it is.

Here's the massive issue with all of this, since we are still sorting out my husband's residence permit, he has to stay in the UK for now.
I think it goes without saying that I am very unhappy with this situation. Hell, I barely made it through the ticket gate for my train to Heathrow without turning around to stay with him, even if it was just a few seconds more before I had to be off to catch my ride.
At this point I am honestly just a bit bitter about having to leave my husband behind in the UK, once again, while I travel back down.
I'd be lying if I were to say that this isn't emotionally draining to a certain extent.
All I am asking for is to be with my husband, at our place, in Austria.

It's not even that I don't *want* to go to the UK anymore, but so help me the lord up above, if I need to be on a plane one more time this month, I might actually lose it lol.
I'm tired.
I need a consistent routine.
I want to be with my husband.
I am running out of "it is what it is"-es.
And honestly, I pray that all the residence stuff is going to be sorted soon, so we can simply enjoy life together once again.

I'm writing this post while I'm on my second flight of the day, this one being from DUS to GRZ.
My legs hurt, because I am too tall to fit in the seats on a Airbus A320 (or A319 for that matter) comfortably, and I am starting to get quite hungry.
I'll probably order myself some takeaway when I get to the hotel.
Oh yeah, my journey is split to two days, because I still have a two hour bus ride back to my place tomorrow, and all flights that would've been earlier in the day or direct were too damn expensive.

_Fun Fact!_  
My total cost of travelling back and forth between the UK and Austria over the last few years almost exceeds 8000&euro;!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.

Anyways, sorry that this is a bit of a middling post, but I just wanted to put up a small sign of life that I am, in fact, not dead yet.
As an apology, please accept this picture of a hungry bird I took while on a walk with my husband.
Cya.
